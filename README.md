# Solidity Docs

This is a repository containing code examples and implementation of examples in the [official Solidity documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.12/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html).

Most of the examples are self-contained in their own folder and scaffolded using the excellent Brownie.
