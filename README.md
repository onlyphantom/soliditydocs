# Solidity Docs

This is a repository containing code examples and implementation of examples in the [official Solidity documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.12/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html).

It is also reference for the YouTube tutorial playlist where we learn Solidity and Brownie through building several smart contracts: [Blockchain Programming w/ Brownie, Ganache, Solidity (Tutorial)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXsFtK46HZxVK1r-Irndd9gMBMdouLrMQ)

Part 1: 
- [Get Started: Ethereum Smart Contract Programming w/ Brownie + Ganache](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAtYl742SQo&list=PLXsFtK46HZxVK1r-Irndd9gMBMdouLrMQ)

Most of the examples are self-contained in their own folder and scaffolded using the excellent Brownie.
